@article{SURYANARAYANA1995153,
	abstract = {An fcc phase has been reported to form in mechanically alloyed titanium-aluminum alloys. This fcc phase forms after an amorphous phase during milling and has been found to be stable up to very high temperatures. Different investigators have interpreted the formation of this fcc phase as (i) a product of crystallization of the amorphous phase, (ii) a supersaturated solid solution of titanium in aluminum, (iii) the disordered form of the γ-TiAl phase, or (iv) a contaminant phase. The present paper analyzes the available results and concludes that this is a contaminant phase, most probably TiN.},
